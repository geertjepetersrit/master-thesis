### Introduction
In this master thesis, the serious game _Diverse Perspectives_ is created in ```Ren'Py```.

In _Diverse Perspectives_, the players steps into the shoes of an Utrecht University student who is about to begin their very first day in Utrecht.
Throughout the day, they encounter dilemmas in the context of diversity. The player's choices to these dilemmas could affect the ending. In total, there are 3 endings: good, neutral and bad.

The game contains two versions. Version A is **with** the perspective switch, while version B is **without** the switch.

The most recent update only contains version **A**. Version B is present in the comments.

It is open source and free for commerical use. Ren'Py can be downloaded [here](https://www.renpy.org/).
